<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Anxhelo Lushka, I'm a graphic designer and frontend developer, currently finishing my studies as a computer engineer
and a heavy open source user and advocate. I contribute to many FOSS projects, such as Fedora, LibreOffice, OpenStreetMap etc. I am a member of <a href="https://openlabs.cc/en" target="blank" rel="noopener">Open Labs Hackerspace</a>, the first hackerspace in Albania, founded in 2012. I am also a Fedora Ambassador and a Document Foundation member.
</p>

<p>In this website I will showcase my best works over time and some articles I write related to events I've organized/participated in, security and privacy in general, tips and tricks etc.</p>

<p>During the last 4 years I have organized tens of events and conferences such as <a href="https://osc.al" target="blank" rel="noopener">OSCAL</a> (Open Source Conference Albania), <a href="https://libocon.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibreOffice Conference</a> and more.</p>
