<p>AnySoftKeyboard is an open source keyboard for Android devices. It has an active community on <a href="https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and is available for Android 1.5 and up devices, so basically for every device possible. It is a private and fast alternative, weighning just 6.5MB, with over 40 supported languages. You can download the app from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F-Droid</a>.<br />I ran across this app a few weeks back and decided to contribute by designing a new website for them.

<p>Privacy Today is an initiative where people talk about all things privacy, open source, libre philosophy and more! I created this main logo and the variations below it to represent this group; the eye in the logo stands for the current stance of the Internet where everything is under surveillance meanwhile the P stands for, you guessed it, "Privacy".<br />You can join the channel by pressing the image above and the group by clicking <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/Awg5A0UW-tzOLX7zMoTDog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>.

<a href="https://activitydaymilano2017.wikitolearn.events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="/assets/img/fsadmilano.jpg" alt="Free Software Activity Day Milano"></a>
<p>An international line-up to find out that Open Source is not just for a selected few, but it is an inclusive creative process: accessible to everyone and where it's important that everyone participates. I created their brand for the entire event, starting with the logo, typography and social media images.</p>
