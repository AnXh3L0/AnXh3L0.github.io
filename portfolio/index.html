			<p class="portfolio">SirVPN was an initiative and one of the first VPN-s based on the new protocol called <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wireguard</a>. The VPN was provided for free for the users (for a test drive period of 14 days) but has now shut down for lack of funding. I helped with the domain name, designed the website (as you might notice it's similar to the one you'll see below) and the logo, based on Indian symbols.</p>

			<p class="portfolio">Privacy Today is an initiative where people talk about all things privacy, open source, libre philosophy and more! I created the main logo and some variations to represent their main groups; the eye in the logo stands for the current stance of the Internet where everything is under surveillance meanwhile the P stands for, you guessed it, "Privacy".<br />You can join the channel by pressing the image above and the group by clicking <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/Awg5A0UW-tzOLX7zMoTDog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>.</p>
