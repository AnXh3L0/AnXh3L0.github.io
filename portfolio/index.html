<p>Privacy Today is an initiative where people talk about all things privacy, open source, libre philosophy and more! I created this main logo and the variations below it to represent this group; the eye in the logo stands for the current stance of the Internet where everything is under surveillance meanwhile the P stands for, you guessed it, "Privacy".<br />You can join the channel by pressing the image above and the group by clicking <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/Awg5A0UW-tzOLX7zMoTDog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>.

<p>Passman is an innovative, opensource password manager for Nextcloud. Store your passwords safely with millitary grade encryption (AES-256bit). I helped create the logo and graphics for their website.</p>

<p>An international line-up to find out that Open Source is not just for a selected few, but it is an inclusive creative process: accessible to everyone and where it's important that everyone participates. I created their brand for the entire event, starting with the logo, typography and social media images.</p>
