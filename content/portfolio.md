K-9 Mail is an open source email client for Android with many advanced features. I stumbled upon an issue on their issue tracker on GitHub related to the website design so I decided to give them a hand and created a new website for the project, using Bootstrap and Jekyll.

AdAway is an open source ad blocker for Android using the hosts file. Their website hadn't been updated since almost two years so I decided to give them a hand and update it using Jekyll and turning it into a visually more attractive site. The work included recreating the AdAway logo in SVG as it wasn't available anywhere and creating an import/export page for host files conversions.

[![SirVPN website](/assets/img/portfolio/sirvpn.png)](https://sirvpn.me)

SirVPN was an initiative and one of the first VPN-s based on the new protocol called [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/). The VPN was provided for free for the users (for a test drive period of 14 days) but has now shut down for lack of funding. I helped with the domain name, designed the website (as you might notice it's similar to the one you'll see below) and the logo, based on Indian symbols.

[![ASK website](/assets/img/portfolio/ask-website.png)](https://anysoftkeyboard.github.io)

AnySoftKeyboard is an open source keyboard for Android devices. It has an active community on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard) and is available for Android 1.5 and up devices, so basically for every device possible. It is a private and fast alternative, weighning just 6.5MB, with over 40 supported languages. You can download the app from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard).  
I ran across this app a few weeks back and decided to contribute by designing a new website for them.

[![LibOCon 2018 Logo](/assets/img/portfolio/libocon.png)](https://libocon.org/2018)

LibOCon is the annual gathering of the [LibreOffice](https://libreoffice.org) community, this time on its 8th year. At LibOCon, LibreOffice users gather to network and meet key LibreOffice developers, designers, localizers, documenters, supporters and marketers, and to learn about the latest in LibreOffice development.  
We at [Ura Design](https://ura.design) worked on the visual identity for the 2018 edition and I dealt with most of the assets and production for printing.

[![Privacy Today Logo](/assets/img/portfolio/privacy-today.png)](https://t.me/privacytoday)

Privacy Today is an initiative where people talk about all things privacy, open source, libre philosophy and more! I created the main logo and some variations to represent their main groups; the eye in the logo stands for the current stance of the Internet where everything is under surveillance meanwhile the P stands for, you guessed it, "Privacy".

[![Passman](/assets/img/portfolio/passman.jpg)](https://passman.cc)

Passman is an innovative, opensource password manager for Nextcloud. Store your passwords safely with millitary grade encryption (AES-256bit). I helped create the logo and graphics for their website.

[![Codeaholics](/assets/img/portfolio/codeaholics.jpg)](https://twitter.com/codeaholics_AL)

Codeaholics was part of Rails Girls Summer of Code, working on the Nextcloud project for the Contacts app. I created their logo and social media images they have used during their scholarship.

[![Free Software Activity Day Milano](/assets/img/portfolio/fsadmilano.jpg)](https://activitydaymilano2017.wikitolearn.events/)

An international line-up to find out that Open Source is not just for a selected few, but it is an inclusive creative process: accessible to everyone and where it's important that everyone participates. I created their brand for the entire event, starting with the logo, typography and social media images.
